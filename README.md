# Brightcove-Project
#In this repository you will find the programs that I used to help in Brightcove tasks, for exampl:
#Retrieve data from their Video Cloud DB via API, 
#store this information in a database or any file system of my choice for this challenge. 
#Process the data you retrieve into information that can be used for decision making. 
#Lastly, host this project on a public server in which we can visually and programmatically consult this information.
